#+TITLE: babel
The current instance of Babel is a loose collection of scripts
organized by language. One day we hope to turn this into something
that resembles Knuth's Literate Programming and Org-mode's
implementation.

This is one of my 'always in design-phase' projects, with many
different implementations scattered throughout repos found on
[[https://lab.rwest.io][lab.rwest.io]] and other private repos (=lob.org=, =babel.org=,
=babel.el=).
